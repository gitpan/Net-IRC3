NAME
    Net::IRC3 - An event system independend IRC protocol module

VERSION
    Version 0.6

SYNOPSIS
    Using the simplistic Net::IRC3::Connection:

       use AnyEvent;
       use Net::IRC3::Connection;

       my $c = AnyEvent->condvar;

       my $con = new Net::IRC3::Connection;

       $con->connect ("localhost", 6667);

       $con->reg_cb (irc_001 => sub { print "$_[1]->{prefix} says i'm in the IRC: $_[1]->{trailing}!\n"; $c->broadcast; 0 });
       $con->send_msg (undef, NICK => undef, "testbot");
       $con->send_msg (undef, USER => 'testbot', "testbot", '*', '0');

       $c->wait;

    Using the more sophisticatd Net::IRC3::Client::Connection:

       use AnyEvent;
       use Net::IRC3::Client::Connection;

       my $c = AnyEvent->condvar;

       my $timer;
       my $con = new Net::IRC3::Client::Connection;

       $con->reg_cb (registered => sub { print "I'm in!\n"; 0 });
       $con->reg_cb (disconnect => sub { print "I'm out!\n"; 0 });
       $con->reg_cb (
          sent => sub {
             if ($_[2] eq 'PRIVMSG') {
                print "Sent message!\n";
                $timer = AnyEvent->timer (after => 1, cb => sub { $c->broadcast });
             }
             1
          }
       );

       $con->send_srv (PRIVMSG => "Hello there i'm the cool Net::IRC3 test script!", 'elmex');

       $con->connect ("localhost", 6667);
       $con->register (qw/testbot testbot testbot/);

       $c->wait;
       undef $timer;

       $con->disconnect;

DESCRIPTION
    NOTE: This module is DEPRECATED, please use AnyEvent::IRC for new
    programs, and possibly port existing Net::IRC3 applications to
    AnyEvent::IRC. Though the API of AnyEvent::IRC has incompatible changes,
    it's still fairly similar.

    The Net::IRC3 module consists of Net::IRC3::Connection,
    Net::IRC3::Client::Connection and Net::IRC3::Util. Net::IRC3 only
    contains this documentation. It manages connections and parses and
    constructs IRC messages.

    Net::IRC3 can be viewed as toolbox for handling IRC connections and
    communications. It won't do everything for you, and you still need to
    know a few details of the IRC protocol.

    Net::IRC3::Client::Connection is a more highlevel IRC connection that
    already processes some messages for you and will generated some events
    that are maybe useful to you. It will also do PING replies for you and
    manage channels a bit.

    Net::IRC3::Connection is a lowlevel connection that only connects to the
    server and will let you send and receive IRC messages.
    Net::IRC3::Connection does not imply any client behaviour, you could
    also use it to implement an IRC server.

    Note that the *::Connection module uses AnyEvent as it's IO event
    subsystem. You can integrate them into any application with a event
    system that AnyEvent has support for (eg. Gtk2 or Event).
